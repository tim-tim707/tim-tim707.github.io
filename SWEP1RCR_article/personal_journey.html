            <h1>My journey through the decompilation and remaster of Star Wars Episode I Racer</h1>
            <p>
                If you are interested about the project, you can go to <a href="index.html">this
                    page</a> instead.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I was younger, I use to play the old Star Wars games such as Rogue Squadron and Star
                Wars Racer. I've always enjoyed these games, and at some point I decided I wanted to
                remaster Star Wars Racer (SWE1R or SWR), because the game was great but the graphics were
                getting
                dated. At that time, it was just a childhood dream that I kept in the back of my head. I
                just thought it would be cool to do it but never started it.
                <br>
                I joined the community in 2019, after playing the full campaign again. This is when I
                discovered multiplayer and community tournaments being held regularly.
            </p>
            <p>
                Fast forward a couple of years and I'm a software engineer student.
                <br>
                During one of my year, I met a younger student that was into reverse engineering and low
                level
                programming talking about how he helped in the decompilation and recompilation of <a
                    href="https://github.com/zeldaret/oot"> Zelda Ocarina of time</a>.
                I thought that if he was able to do it being younger than me, I had no excuses not starting
                my own project. I asked him some advices about how he did it and what tools he used / what
                was the process. At that time in my studies I had more free time than before,
                so I started the decompilation repository for the game the 28 January 2023, just over two
                years from now.<br>
                My overall plan was:<br>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Understand the game well enough to replace the original renderer by our own
                </li>
                <li>
                    Make pretty modern graphics with <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physically_based_rendering">Physically
                        based rendering</a> and Image based lighting
                </li>
                <li>
                    Replace the models with better quality assets and textures
                </li>
            </ul>
            I had already learn the basics of graphics
            programming such as OpenGL and shader programming, as well as the rendering cited before
            techniques, and it's a programming field I really enjoyed. I had, however, no competency in
            Reverse Engineering and decompilation, and only a very basic understanding of assembly.
            Well, if my friend learned it, what stops me from learning it too ?
            </p>
            <p>
                Thats at that time that I decided more clearly on what the decompilation project should
                be, after talking to friends. On the Legal aspect, I see that reverse engineering is a grey
                area as long as no harm is done. I decided to not decompile the whole game and not try
                for matching decompilation since this could be enabling piracy. On the other hand, the
                modding scene for Star Wars BattleFront 2 (2005 edition on PC and PS2) was really big and
                flourishing, and they were providing great value for players. That's what I wanted to do for
                Star Wars Racer, even though the community is much smaller.
            </p>
            <p>
                The following months would be a mix of merging knowledge we have found here and there about
                the game, and slow decompilation, scraping every bit we can so that we can make sense of
                what is going on where. On ghidra, that would be either trying to find a small function that
                is sufficiently independent to understand it on its own, or find references between global
                data and functions to infer its use and meaning. Sometimes, understanding how a global
                variable interacted with the code could unlock larger comprehension of the game, and
                sometimes I would just understand one or two random function each evening for days.
                <br>
                Some systems would always be referenced such as the game object
                management system, while others much less (Sound and graphics).
            </p>
            <h2>Decompilation and technical part</h2>
            <h3>Starting the project</h3>
            <p>
                Looking at the community efforts, there
                was already some work done on decompilation and porting such as
                <a href="https://github.com/OpenSWE1R/openswe1r">openswe1r</a>,
                <a href="https://github.com/OpenSWE1R/swe1r-re">swe1r-re</a> from JayFoxRox, and
                <a href="https://github.com/everalert/swe1r-decomp">swe1r-decomp</a> from Galeforce. The
                first step of the plan would be to aggregate all the work done here and there into a big
                decompilation project, which would help me go faster, help others to reduce the duplication
                of work, and be an easier introduction to reverse engineering for me. I would thus base my
                work from where JayFoxRox stopped, the previous guy working on decompilation, and merge
                informations from the other sources. He had already left about 4 years ago at the time, but
                left some valuable notes about various function of the game. This was perfect for me ! There
                was already some work done that I could compare on Ghidra and see the back in forth between
                assembly and the C code equivalent he made. Similarly, LightningPirate had a private
                repository being untouched for about 2 years where he had notes, which he happily
                shared to me.

                Starting from these notes was really helpful since I didn't have to start from scratch and
                learn everything at once.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the reverse engineer part, I started with the basics such as dumping all the strings to
                see if anything was popping out. Indeed, some strings already give valuable bits of
                information
            </p>

                Appart from In-Game strings easily recognizable, some debug path that
                should not have been there spiked my curiosity. Google would point to
                <a href="https://github.com/shinyquagsire23/OpenJKDF2">OpenJKDF2</a>, a very similar
                project than the one I was attempting, but already much more advanced.
                It turns out Jedi Knight Dark Forces 2 has some similar engine library function than what we
                can find in SWR. Let's just try to match every JKDF2 function with ours !
                Speaking with the members of the JKDF2 community, one member, Urgon informed me about the
                Jones3D being part of the game
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Jones_and_the_Infernal_Machine">Indiana Jones
                    and the Infernal Machine</a> released by LucasArt for N64. He was working on a
                decompilation for the later and provided me with additionnal informations about the engine.
                Notice that the game was released for N64, and that Star Wars Racer was also released on
                both PC and N64.
            </p>
            <p>
                The math library are almost identical for the 3 games, which can be explained
                by LucasArt developping so much games that engine reuse would be common
                practice, like in many studios at the time.
                <br>
                With the merging going at a good pace, some pure functions would
                already be decompiled, which help understand more complex functions, and so
                on. This provide a compounding effect that makes decompilation faster and faster (As well as
                my skills improving in understanding assembly and decompilation)
            </p>
            <pre><code class="language-C", style="font-size: 18px">
// TODO: vector and matrix pure functions

</code></pre>
            <p>
                The game uses a single id for each asset (model, sprite, texture), that is used to fetch the
                corresponding data by reading the asset blocks. The enum for the ids also leaked in the
                release of the Nintendo Switch version, with the source files available next to the data
                blocks. That's some good luck ! We were already in the process of finding which Id
                correspond to which model, so this was a nice time saver.
                <br>
                The textures have different format with or without palette and transparency. The models have
                hierarchy informations and different node types (with or without children or transform).
                Some data that we couldn't make sense of at first, was later discovered to be N64 display
                list for GSP in the F3DEX_GBI_2 format, a microcode used to control the rendering. If you
                are interested, here is a link to the <a
                    href="https://ultra64.ca/files/documentation/online-manuals/man/pro-man/pro04/index4.5.html">N64
                    programming Manual section</a> and the <a
                    href="https://ultra64.ca/files/documentation/online-manuals/man/n64man/gsp/gsp.html">N64
                    GSP Function reference</a>.

                This quickly made us discover some hardcoded limits of the game that would be very hard
                to fix.
                <br>
                For example, there is a fixed number of triangles the game can show at once, and a limited
                number and total byte size for textures. To circumvent these limits, having a separate
                renderer is much easier and powerful than trying to patch every part of the game that
                reference them.

            </p>
            <p>
                Another good approach to understand the inner working of the game would be the IO with
                config files and assets. Some config files for mappings, sounds, visual quality are parsed
                by the game into global variables that can be understood and help understand other functions
                where they are used. All the assets of the game are parsed from 4 binary blobs named
                modelblock, splineblock, spriteblock and textureblock. The understanding of these files
                would be essential in understanding the custom format of the 3D models defined in it. This
                could unlock potential manipulation of in-game assets via
                decompression-modification-recompression in a tool like blender, as long as the format
                matches what the game expect. These file and their format would remain a mystery for a lot
                of time, since their structure were not like the other games.
            </p>
            <p>
                In November 2023, Aphex shared custom code he had to parse the structure of the
                binary blocks. This gold mine of knowledge helped us tremendously in
                understanding both the static data of the binary blobs of the game, as
                well as the parsing logic inside the game. He was working on it for a long time and cross
                referenced multiple versions of the game to check his script was working properly.
                He is the one that knows most about the game assets, and was the first to
                decompress, modify and recompress a binary asset block into the game,
                which was an important milestone for this project.
                (https://discord.com/channels/441839750555369474/441842584592056320/1177552168392347648)
            </p>
            <p>
                With math function, camera functions, 3D functions, system functions,
                our understanding grew enough that one year later, another community
                member named tilman managed to hook and replace enough functions to run
                imgui and a d3d api replacement, proving that we had enough
                decompilation already to start replacing graphics.
                With this proof of concept working, most of my time from this point onward went into
                improving the renderer replacement. After a bit more than one year of slow and monotonous
                decompilation, the fun part of building the gltf renderer was upon me !
                I wanted support for renderDoc since its a powerful tool that would greatly help.
                Unfortunately, the replacement was done with immediate rendering to be as close as possible
                to the original one.
                Tilman and I started to swap the d3d rendering for openGL rendering immediate mode at first,
                then replaced the immediate mode openGL with the more modern api, and we had renderDoc
                support just like that !
            </p>
            <p>
                The following months would be implementing the
                <a href="https://registry.khronos.org/glTF/specs/2.0/glTF-2.0.html">gltf specification</a>
                with the help of the
                <a href="https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Renderer">gltf sample renderer</a> and
                the
                <a href="https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Models">gltf sample models</a>,
                which are very high quality source of information.
                I had to be careful about some models since pods are animated from the game's data (When
                turning,
                when breaking an engine, going up and down slopes).
            </p>
            <p>
                I've done the first release of the mod on February 6 2025, 2 years after the beginning of
                this project.<br>
                What I thought would be a 4-6 month project took much longer than expected, and the journey
                to get there was a great experience. The beginning of the project was exciting, followed by
                months of boring decompilation, until Aphex and Tilman breakthrough, which unlocked our
                ability to develop with our own code. Galeforce and LightningPirate were always here to
                answer my questions, which would either be "no one knows how this work yet" or be very
                precise and solve my issues. I could not have done it without each of them.
                <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                When starting this project, I didn't have much self-confidence, and only ever did school
                project that would re-invent the wheel. I wanted to complete the hardest possible project I
                could think of, and I believe I finally succeeded in making my childhood dream a reality.
                I've gained the habit regularly coding on the evening and I find it to be a greatly
                satisfying activity. I'm much more confident in my ability to create and build things
                and I have lots of ideas for future projects. If I had an advice to my past self it would be
                to go for it now and think about it later. I'm grateful that I was very bored at that
                point in my life to start what I always wanted to do. I feel that with the amount of
                entertainement of today, I was rarely bored enough to let my brain become very willing to
                build or create things. Now, I just wish I had more time to build what I want.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've always wanted to build tools to enable artists and this project is a good example of
                that. In the community, Leadphalanx working on High Resolution pods and DigitalUnity who
                made the lego mini pods are already stress showing what can be done with this new tool. I
                wish one day we'll have remastered all the tracks and pods, but as unpaid contributors, I
                think we are already doing an amazing work.
