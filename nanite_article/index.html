        <h1>Unreal Engine 5 Nanite explained</h1>
        <text>
            When Nanite got presented by Unreal in 2020<sup><a href="https://youtu.be/qC5KtatMcUw?si=qyiJhpOMmDkylBNa">1</a></sup>, it looked like an exceptional breakthrough for artists.
            At the time I was still learning Blender and struggled with having a proper mesh density.
            My amazement for this level of engineering grew with the deep dive presentation at the SIGGRAPH 2021<sup><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eviSykqSUUw&ab_channel=SIGGRAPHAdvancesinReal-TimeRendering">2</a></sup>.
            This fascination lead me to implement a Proof of Concept of the Algorithm based on the pdf, comments an slides provided <a href="https://advances.realtimerendering.com/s2021/Karis_Nanite_SIGGRAPH_Advances_2021_final.pdf">here</a>.

        <h2>But what is Nanite ?</h2>
        <text>
            For those who don't know what Nanite is, here is a recap: Nanite is a "virtual geometry system".
            Similarily to virtual memory, it is a memory optimisation that allow for much larger 3D mesh and models to be available and be used by a game.
            This allow for a huge quantity of data that wouldn't be able to fit in RAM to still be rendered in real-time.
            Goodbye re-topology, mesh optimisation and normal map baking for artists !

        <h2>My proof of concept</h2>
        <text>
            I'm going over many details and missing a lot of interesting reflections that you can find in the <a href="https://advances.realtimerendering.com/s2021/Karis_Nanite_SIGGRAPH_Advances_2021_final.pdf">notes</a> and I can only encourage you to give it a read.
            It's very different than any "rigorous" scientific paper but much easier to understand.
            I've also implemented only a subset of the entire solution, and it is nowhere near optimised.
            I still find the topics encountered along the way interesting.

            Nanite use a Level of Detail (LOD) Hierarchy in order to render only the minimal amount of data.
            My implementation build the LOD Hierarchy from the bottom up and form a Tree (it's actually a graph, but we'll see that later).
            We should then start with our base mesh and simplify it incrementally.
            <br><br>
            Enter the <a href="https://github.com/sp4cerat/Fast-Quadric-Mesh-Simplification">Fast Quadric Mesh Simplification algorithm</a> available as a C library.
            The algorithm is described in the following paper: <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./garland/Papers/quadrics.pdf">Surface Simplification Using Quadric Error Metrics</a> and the standford lecture notes <a href="https://graphics.stanford.edu/courses/cs468-10-fall/LectureSlides/08_Simplification.pdf">here</a>.
            I initially learned about this algorithm while reading the nanite notes and reading through the paper above.
            Let's learn this technique as well then !

        <h3>Tangent one: Simplifying Meshs</h3>
        The Quadric mesh simplification is a technique to reduce the number of vertices, edges and faces of a mesh while keeping the most accurate representation of said mesh.
        It is well illustrated with a simple drawing:
        <br>
        <img src="images/error_quadric.png" alt="error quadric">
        <br>
        We'll derive an error on each vertex depending on the planes the vertex is part of.
        This will enable us to derive a new updated position for the vertex once we simplify around it, keeping a more accurate form.
        We'll then remove vertices by collapsing them by pairs using the quadric error as a threshold.
        The github implementation I used allows for a target vertices count to be specified, which will be useful later.
